This script converts .fas (FASTA) files into Phylip format.

It counts number of sequences and length, putting them at the top of the file as Phylip requires.

To use it, simply type:

python fasta_to_phy.py <file.fas>

The output is a file with the same name as the original but with .phy extension.
